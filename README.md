### KnightBox
Repository for my 2d combat sandbox game "Knight Box" made entirely in html, CSS and JavaScript, as a Final Project of my Internship at Pakistan International Airlines

---
A browser-based animation and input testbed for a fully controllable 2D knight character using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by games like *Apple Knight* and *Castlevania*, this project focuses entirely on movement, input control, and animation — with no gameplay, levels, or enemies **yet**.

#### Features
- Responsive input handling (keyboard controls)
- Fully animated knight character using sprite sheets
- Frame-based animation system with timing control
- State-driven behavior (idle, run, jump, attack, crouch, etc.)
- Directional movement with horizontal sprite flipping
- Fixed-size canvas with movement boundaries

#### Tech Stack
- HTML for structure
- CSS for layout
- JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries)

#### Animation Format
- Spritesheets are horizontal strips
- Each frame is 120x80 pixels
- Separate PNG per animation 

#### Development Goals
- Build a polished movement and animation sandbox
- Serve as a foundation for future game projects
- No external assets or servers required — everything runs locally

#### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a your browser
3. add controls here  >:3
