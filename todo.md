#### TODO:

1. in current  script.js the frameDelay is set to 150, and the idle animation is looking smooth-ish
confirm the working, cuz you have frameDelays in seconds in 'knight.js' animations

2. make base rigs for the knight and canvas.

3. Add Movement functionality to the rig:
    1. Left 
    2. Right
    3. Jump
